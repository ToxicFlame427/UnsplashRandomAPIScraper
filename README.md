# UnsplashRandomAPIScraper
A program that utilizes the Unsplash API and random endpoint for finding images. I made this for fun, no real practical use.

**Note:** This program doen not infringe any of the rules outlined in the Unsplash terms of use. Images on unsplash are all public use and free images (outlined <a href="https://unsplash.com/license">here</a>).

This program will download images found via the random endpoint within the Unsplash API.
These images will be downloaded to a relative `images` directory with random integer names.
An API key is required (I did not provide my own), the SLN project file for visual studio is available in the code files so it can be modified with your own key.

Useful for finding image diversity around Unsplash. (I have found quite a few really nice images with this program)
